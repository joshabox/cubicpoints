This code verifies all computational claims made in the paper "Cubic and quartic points on modular curves using generalised symmetric Chabauty" by Josha Box, Stevan Gajovic and Pip Goodman.

Each file named "X0..." verifies all claims made about the relevant modular curve. They should be run with the files "ozmansiksek.m", "Qcurvetest.m" and either "Cubicsieve.m" or both "quarticsieve.m" and "X065quarticpts.m" in the same directory.
